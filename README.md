# My go-to pylint & mypy configuration

This is my go-to initial linter configuration when setting up a new project.


## Usage

Just curl [.flake8](https://github.com/kuchynkm/linter-configs/raw/master/.flake8) and [mypy.ini](https://github.com/kuchynkm/linter-configs/raw/master/mypy.ini) to your project root. 

I also like to set the checker as a part of my [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/kuchynkm/pre-commit-hooks-template.git).
